To do this, an admin would simply type the desired password into the Group Policy editor. The system would then create an XML file (like <code>Groups.xml</code> or <code>ScheduledTasks.xml</code>) inside that policy's folder on the SYSVOL share.</p> <p>To give the appearance of security, the password was not stored in plaintext. It was placed in a field called <code>cPassword</code> and encrypted with AES-256.</p> <p>The Fatal Flaw: The AES key used for this encryption was static. It was the same key across every Windows installation in the world. Worse, Microsoft published this key publicly on MSDN. This meant that anyone who could read the XML file could use the public key to instantly decrypt the password.

I also built a homelab to mimic the exam environment. Spoiler: It helped a lot. I refined my methodology, experimented with new tools, and learned a hard truth: not all tools are created equal. </p> <p>For example, what’s your go-to tunneling tool? <code>Proxychains</code>? <code>Chisel</code>? <code>Sshuttle</code>? I’m team <code>ligolo-ng</code> because it plays nice with <code>nmap</code>, unlike some of its clunkier cousins. Tool choice matters, folks.</p> <p>When the second attempt rolled around, I was ready. The exam environment hadn’t changed, so I hit my previous progress in an hour. But then, predictably, I got stuck again. I was this close to rage-quitting when I decided to take a nap instead. Best. Decision. Ever. Post-nap, I enumerated like a madman, and—poof—the answer was staring me in the face. I felt like I’d just missed the “You Are Here” sign on a map.</p> <p>An hour later, I was Domain Admin. I couldn’t believe it. I screamed, called my buddy, and probably woke up half the neighborhood. The next day, I reset the lab to take pristine screenshots (pro move) and realized I could’ve pwned the domain in an hour if I’d enumerated properly from the start. This exam isn’t technically brutal—it’s an enumeration marathon.</p> <p>Then came the debrief meeting. I made a rookie mistake: no presentation. There’s a 15-minute timer, and if you can’t walk through your report clearly, it could tank your score. I babbled my way through, finishing with 20 seconds to spare.
