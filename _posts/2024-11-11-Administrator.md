The **Administrator** machine on Hack The Box is an excellent example of how common misconfigurations can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. Through a combination of Kerberoasting, improper DACL permissions, and poor password management, I was able to escalate privileges and gain full control over the machine. This exercise reinforced the importance of regular security audits, proper account configuration, and strong password practices to defend against real-world threats.

## Reconnaissance

### Port scanning

I'll start by running an Nmap service and version scan with the default scripts. This will help identify any open ports and provide information about the services running on them, giving us valuable targets for further exploration.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/htb/administrator]

{: .prompt-tip }

After reviewing the Nmap scan results, we can confidently deduce that the target is a Domain Controller. This is evident from the presence of port 88/tcp, which is commonly associated with Kerberos authentication.

### FTP

Another interesting port is 21/tcp (FTP). However, attempts to log in using Olivia's account were unsuccessful.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]

```

### SMB

Next, I checked if Olivia had access to any interesting SMB shares on the server, but found nothing of note.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/htb/administrator]

```

### User Enumeration

Since I already have Olivia's credentials, I’ll use `netexec` to enumerate the users in the domain and save the list to a file for later use.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]

### Bloodhound

Next, I ran `bloodhound-python` to gather additional information on potential attack paths within the environment.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/htb/administrator]

#### Bloodhound Analysis

1. From the BloodHound graph, we can see that **Olivia** has the ability to perform `PSRemote` into the target. Additionally, under **First Degree Object Control**, **Olivia** has **GenericAll** privileges over **Michael**.

2. **Michael** has the ability to change **Benjamin's** password.
![Michael has the ability to change Benjamin's password.](/assets/img/htb/administrator/htb-administrator-bh1.png)

3. There is a user named **Ethan** who has `DCSync` privileges within the domain.

4. **Emily** has **GenericWrite** privileges on Ethan's account.
![Emily has `GenericWrite` privileges on Ethan's account](/assets/img/htb/administrator/htb-administrator-ethan.png)

> The **DCSync** attack simulates the behavior of a Domain Controller and asks other Domain Controllers to replicate information using the **Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR)**. Because MS-DRSR is a valid and necessary function of Active Directory, it cannot be turned off or disabled.

## Foothold

## Targetted Kerberoasting

`targetedKerberoast` is a Python script similar to other tools like `GetUserSPNs.py` that can extract kerberos hashes for user accounts with a Service Principal Name (SPN) set. What sets targetedKerberoast apart is its ability to go a step further: if a user doesn't have an SPN set, the script attempts to set one by exploiting write permissions on the servicePrincipalName attribute. It then retrieves the "Kerberos" hash and cleans up by deleting the temporary SPN it set for the operation. This technique is known as targeted Kerberoasting.

The tool can be run against all users in the domain, a specific list of users, or a single user specified via the command-line interface (CLI).

Let's clone the [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast) repository and proceed.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]
└─$ git clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git
Cloning into 'targetedKerberoast'...

```

Using `targetedKerberoast.py`, I attempted to extract the Kerberos hash for Michael's account. However, the operation initially failed with the error: `KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW (Clock skew too great)`.

> Kerberos time skew is the maximum amount of time that the internal clocks of hosts in a Kerberos authentication system can be out of sync. The default value for clock skew is five minutes, or 300 seconds.

[*] Starting kerberoast attacks
[*] Attacking user (michael)
[!] Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)
```
To resolve the issue, I quickly synchronized my attacker's machine time with the target using `rdate`.
```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]
└─$ sudo rdate -n administrator.htb
Tue Nov 12 05:37:36 IST 2024
```
After syncing the time, I was able to successfully retrieve the Kerberos hash for **Michael's** account using the targeted Kerberoasting attack.
```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]
└─$ ./targetedKerberoast/targetedKerberoast.py --request-user michael -o michael_hash -d administrator.htb --dc-ip 10.129.106.223 -u Olivia -p 'ichliebedich'

```
## Password Cracking - 1
I attempted to crack the Kerberos hash using `hashcat` with the **rockyou** dictionary, but unfortunately, it wasn't successful.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]

Cracking performance lower than expected?                 

* Append -O to the commandline.
  This lowers the maximum supported password/salt length (usually down to 32).

* Append -w 3 to the commandline.
  This can cause your screen to lag.

* Append -S to the commandline.
  This has a drastic speed impact but can be better for specific attacks.

## Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation

Since Olivia’s account has **GenericAll** privileges over Michael’s account, she can reset his password and then use it to initiate a WinRM session under his credentials.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.106.223 -u Olivia -p 'ichliebedich'

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\olivia\Documents> Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity michael -NewPassword $password
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\olivia\Documents> 
```

Looking at the BloodHound graph, we see that Michael has the **ForceChangePassword** permission for **Benjamin's** account. Using the same method as before, I reset Benjamin's password.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/administrator]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.106.223 -u michael -p 'Welcome@123456'

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\michael\Documents> Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity benjamin -NewPassword $password
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\michael\Documents> 
```

Since Benjamin's account isn’t a member of the **Remote Management Users** group, I couldn’t use it for a WinRM session. However, when I checked the `FTP` site, I found an interesting file named `Backup.psafe3`.

Fortunately, we can brute-force our way to the master password using `hashcat`.

> .psafe3 extension belongs to the databse format used by Password Safe, a password manager.

Next, I installed [Password Safe](https://pwsafe.org/) on my Windows machine and used the master password to open the Backup.psafe3 database.

Inside the database, I discovered the following usernames and their corresponding passwords:

This is good news. `Emily` has GenericWrite privileges on Ethan's account, and Ethan has `DCSync` rights

> With **GenericWrite** over a user, we can write to the “msds-KeyCredentialLink” attribute. Writing to this property allows an attacker to create “Shadow Credentials” on the object and authenticate as the principal using Kerberos PKINIT.
Alternatively, we can write to the "servicePrincipalNames" attribute and perform a targeted kerberoasting attack.

The password for Ethan is `limpbizkit`. With this, I can now extract the complete `NTDS.dit` secrets using Impacket’s `secretsdump.py` script.

>NTDS.DIT stands for New Technology Directory Services Directory Information Tree. It serves as the primary database file within Microsoft’s Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Essentially, NTDS.DIT stores and organizes all the information related to objects in the domain, including users, groups, computers, and more. It acts as the backbone of Active Directory, housing critical data such as user account details, passwords, group memberships, and other object attributes.
