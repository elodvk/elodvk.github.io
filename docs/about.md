Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for tackling challenges and unraveling complex puzzles. My journey into the world of cybersecurity began with a fascination for technology and a desire to understand how things work beneath the surface.

Currently, I’m diving deep into Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like Hack The Box. These hands-on experiences not only sharpen my skills but also fuel my excitement for the field. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and think critically, and I thrive on the adrenaline that comes from solving tough problems.

This documentation site is primarily focused on my preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. I’ll be sharing my insights, study strategies, and resources that I find helpful along the way. Whether you’re a fellow aspiring OSCP candidate, a seasoned professional, or just curious about cybersecurity, I hope you find something valuable here.

Join me on this journey as I explore the intricacies of penetration testing, share tips for navigating CTFs, and document my progress toward achieving the OSCP. Let’s connect, learn, and grow together in this ever-evolving field!
