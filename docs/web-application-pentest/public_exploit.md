Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our Nmap scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like SSH or ftp.


### Finding Public Exploits

Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with `exploit` to see if we get any results.

A well-known tool for this purpose is searchsploit, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

Then, we can use `searchsploit` to search for a specific application by its name, as follows:

```shell
┌──(elodvk㉿kali)-[~/htb-academy]
└─$ searchsploit openssh 7.2
