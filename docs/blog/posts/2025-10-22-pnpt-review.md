On **September 3, 2025**, I finally tamed the beast known as the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) exam. This blog is my victory lap, a chance to share the highs, lows, and downright facepalm moments of my journey. It’s also a love letter to my future self as I gear up for the OSCP (fingers crossed). So, grab a coffee—or an energy drink if you’re feeling my late-night hacking vibes—and let’s dive into how I survived this cyber rollercoaster.

## My Prep: Overconfidence Meets Lazy Town

Picture this: I’m an Active Directory (AD) wizard with over eight years as a sysadmin under my belt. I’ve wrangled forests and domains so complex they’d make your head spin. I’ve performed full forest recoveries, hardened systems with CIS benchmarks (spoiler: one wrong Group Policy setting can ruin your day), and debugged AD issues like it’s just another Tuesday. So, when I heard the PNPT was AD-heavy, I thought, “Pfft, I’ve got this in the bag.”

Add to that my year-long obsession with Hack The Box (HTB) machines—many at *Insane* difficulty—and I was practically strutting into the exam like a cybersecurity peacock. The PNPT is considered entry-level, so I figured I could skip the course. Big mistake. I got lazy, skimming reviews that said the Practical Ethical Hacker (PEH) module was enough. Newsflash: shortcuts are great for GPS, not for cert exams.

I did, however, binge YouTube and Medium reviews the day before my first attempt. Every single one screamed: **ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE!** Some folks couldn’t even get a foothold, which sent my overconfident brain into a mild panic spiral.

## First Attempt: A Comedy of Errors

The exam claimed to be a “real-world” pentest. Yeah, right. If the real world involves banging your head against a keyboard for 48 hours, then sure. I struggled hard with the OSINT portion, not because it was technically brutal, but because I forgot the golden rule: stick to the basics. It took me *two days* to realize I was overcomplicating things. 

By day three, I finally got a foothold. Hallelujah! But then I dove headfirst into rabbit holes, chasing shiny distractions like a cat with a laser pointer. By day four, I was so exhausted I threw in the towel. Reviews suggested submitting a report even if you fail, as it might earn you a hint. I didn’t bother—because, honestly, what hint was going to save me from my own stubbornness?

### Lessons from the First Flop
- **This ain’t a CTF.** Capture The Flag challenges are like: “Grab the user flag, pwn the root, flex on Discord.” The PNPT? It’s more like, “Chill, you might not need to be root to win.” Sometimes, less is more.
- Don’t treat every box like it’s hiding a secret flag. Focus on what’s in front of you.

## Second Attempt: Redemption Arc

After my spectacular faceplant, I went back to HTB with a vengeance, grinding AD-focused machines like my life depended on it. I also built a homelab to mimic the exam environment. Spoiler: It helped *a lot*. I refined my methodology, experimented with new tools, and learned a hard truth: not all tools are created equal. 

For example, what’s your go-to tunneling tool? `Proxychains`? `Chisel`? `Sshuttle`? I’m team `ligolo-ng` because it plays nice with `nmap`, unlike some of its clunkier cousins. Tool choice matters, folks.

When the second attempt rolled around, I was ready. The exam environment hadn’t changed, so I hit my previous progress in *an hour*. But then, predictably, I got stuck again. I was *this close* to rage-quitting when I decided to take a nap instead. Best. Decision. Ever. Post-nap, I enumerated like a madman, and—*poof*—the answer was staring me in the face. I felt like I’d just missed the “You Are Here” sign on a map.

An hour later, I was Domain Admin. I couldn’t believe it. I screamed, called my buddy, and probably woke up half the neighborhood. The next day, I reset the lab to take pristine screenshots (pro move) and realized I could’ve pwned the domain in an hour if I’d enumerated properly from the start. This exam isn’t technically brutal—it’s an enumeration marathon.

Then came the debrief meeting. I made a rookie mistake: no presentation. There’s a 15-minute timer, and if you can’t walk through your report clearly, it could tank your score. I babbled my way through, finishing with *20 seconds* to spare. Talk about cutting it close!

### Lessons from the Second Shot
1. **Enumerate like it’s your job.** Because it is.
2. Take breaks. Hydrate. Dehydration is the real enemy.
3. Screenshots are your BFF. Document every step like you’re making a scrapbook.
4. Prep a PowerPoint for the debrief. Trust me.
5. Watch the 15-minute timer like a hawk.
6. Celebrate the small wins. You got a foothold? Pop some confetti.

## Tips to Slay the PNPT
- **Choose your tools wisely.** Some tools are like that one friend who’s great at parties but useless in a crisis. For example, `impacket` scripts are gold, but `netexec` often does the same job faster.
- **Don’t sleep on local admin accounts.** Just because a machine is domain-joined doesn’t mean it’s free of juicy local creds.
- **Go beyond the course.** The PEH is great, but if you want to be a pentesting rockstar, dive into external resources. HTB, TryHackMe, and YouTube are your playgrounds.

## Final Thoughts
The PNPT isn’t just about technical chops—it’s about grit, patience, and not being too lazy to enumerate. I went from overconfident slacker to Domain Admin in two attempts, and I’m still kicking myself for those rabbit holes. If I can do it, so can you. Just keep calm, enumerate like a pro, and maybe don’t skip the course like I did.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got an OSCP to prep for. Wish me luck!
