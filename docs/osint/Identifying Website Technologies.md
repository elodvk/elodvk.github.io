title: Identifying Website Technologies
---


You can identify a website's technologies using **browser extensions**, **online tools**, and **command-line scanners**. These tools work by analyzing HTTP headers, source code, and directory structures to detect the frameworks, servers, and analytics services a site uses.

## Browser Extensions (The Easiest Method) üåê

Browser extensions are the quickest and easiest way to see the technology stack of a website as you browse. They overlay information directly in your browser.

### Wappalyzer

**Wappalyzer** is the most popular tool in this category. It's a browser extension that creates a list of technologies it detects on the current website, showing you everything from the web server and programming language to the advertising networks and analytics tools.

* **How it Works**: It identifies technologies by detecting unique patterns in the website's source code, cookies, and network responses.
* **Information Gained**:
    * **CMS**: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal
    * **Frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue.js
    * **Server Software**: Nginx, Apache, IIS
    * **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Hotjar
    * **Programming Language**: PHP, Ruby, Java

### BuiltWith

**BuiltWith** is another powerful extension that provides an extremely detailed list of a site's technologies, often including the date it first detected a particular technology on the site.

## Online Scanners üíª

If you don't want to install an extension, several websites let you input a URL to get a detailed technology report.

### Netcraft

**Site Report by Netcraft** is a classic tool that provides a deep dive into a website's server-side information.

* **Objective**: To get detailed information about a site's hosting, SSL/TLS certificates, and network infrastructure.
* **Information Gained**:
    * **Hosting Provider**: Amazon Web Services, GoDaddy, etc.
    * **Netblock Owner**: The organization that owns the IP address range.
    * **SSL/TLS Details**: Certificate issuer, validity period, and configuration.
    * **Site History**: Changes in IP address or operating system over time.

## Command-Line Tools (For Automation and Deeper Scans) ‚öôÔ∏è

Command-line tools are essential for penetration testers as they can be scripted and often provide more detailed, low-level information.

### WhatWeb

**WhatWeb** is a powerful, next-generation scanner included in Kali Linux. It uses over 1,800 plugins to identify a vast array of technologies.

* **Objective**: To identify technologies with a high level of detail, including version numbers.
* **Example Usage**:
    ```bash
    whatweb example.com
    ```
* **Example Output**:
    ```
    [http://example.com](http://example.com) [200 OK]
    Apache[2.4.29]
    Country[UNITED STATES]
    HTML5
    HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)]
    JQuery
    PHP[7.2.24]
    Script
    Title[Example Domain]
    X-Frame-Options[SAMEORIGIN]
    ```
    This output tells you the web server (Apache 2.4.29), operating system (Ubuntu), and programming language (PHP 7.2.24) at a glance.

## Manual Techniques (For When Tools Fail) üïµÔ∏è

Sometimes, tools can be blocked or misleading. Manually inspecting a website's code and network traffic is a fundamental skill.

### 1. View Page Source (`Ctrl+U`)

The HTML source code is full of clues.

* **What to Look For**:
    * **Comments**: ``
    * **Linked Files**: Paths like `/wp-content/` strongly indicate WordPress. Paths like `/sites/default/files/` suggest Drupal.
    * **Script Tags**: You can see which JavaScript libraries (like React or jQuery) are being loaded.

### 2. Check HTTP Headers

Headers sent from the server often explicitly state the technology being used. You can view these in your browser's **Developer Tools** (F12) under the "Network" tab or with a command-line tool like `curl`.

* **Command**:
    ```bash
    curl -I [http://example.com](http://example.com)
    ```
* **What to Look For**:
    * **`Server`**: `Server: nginx/1.18.0`
    * **`X-Powered-By`**: `X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1.0` or `X-Powered-By: ASP.NET`
    * **`Set-Cookie`**: Cookies like `wp-settings-` are a clear sign of WordPress.
